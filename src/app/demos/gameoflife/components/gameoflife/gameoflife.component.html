    The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway. It is a zero-player game, with a board of cells. They can be alive or dead 
    depending on the iteration with the neighbours. The rules are:
    <ul>
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ul>
    This implementation generates a random initial states, an evolves from there with the previous rules. All written in Angular.
